# Corpora from "dark" platforms
*Collection of corpora compiled from so-called "dark" platforms.*

*Maintained by: Dr. Sviatlana Höhn (University of Luxembourg).*

Messengers such as Telegram are often used by actors who prefer to be "in the shadow", such as extreme right political movements and COVID-19 deniers but also oppressed political organisations in non-pluralistic systems and democracy defenders. Zeng and Schäfer (2021) describe such platforms as "dark" because they are less regulated and promote very much extreme, and even illegal content, but can also provide a safe area to fight for the rights in authoritarian regimes.

By compiling and sharing corpora from "dark" platforms we enable new scientific discussion and facilitate research reproducibility. This in turn may speed-up discussions about content regulation on "dark" platforms. This is why we decided to make this repository a place for sharing and linking our and other people's corpora from "dark" platforms

## Telegram corpora

### BelElect Telegram

The dataset contains Telegram posts from 1.08.2020 to 14.04.2021 covering the time of the presidential elections in Belarus and the protests in the country after the elections. The protests were motivated by the accusation of falsification of the election results. These events split the country in state  and opposition supporters. 

We included four state-supporting channels ONT NEWS, BelTA, Zheltye Slivy and Pool Pervogo, and four opposition channels BelSAT, Belarus Seychas, Belamova and TUT.BY with posts in Russian and Belorussian languages. The entire dataset was downloaded on April 15, 2021 using the built-in function of the Telegram messenger. The dataset contains 140.388 Telegram posts (76.918 opposition and 63.470 state); 109.721 posts contain non-empty text (58.976 opposition and 50.745 state). We limited the size of images and media files to 8 GB. The media files exceeding this limit were not included into download. They can be added using the message ID and channel ID.
