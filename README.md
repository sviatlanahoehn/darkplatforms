# darkplatforms
Collection of corpora compiled from so-called "dark" platforms

messengers such as Telegram are often used by actors who prefer to be "in the shadow", such as extreme right political movements and COVID-19 deniers but also oppressed political organisations in non-pluralistic systems and democracy defenders. Zeng and Schäfer (2021) describe such platforms as "dark" because they are less regulated and promote very much extreme, and even illegal content, but can also provide a safe area to fight for the rights in authoritarian regimes.

By compiling and sharing corpora from "dark" platforms we enable new scientific discussion and facilitate research reproducibility. This in turn may speed-up discussions about content regulation on "dark" platforms. This is why we decided to make this repository a place for sharing and linking our and other people's corpora from "dark" platforms
